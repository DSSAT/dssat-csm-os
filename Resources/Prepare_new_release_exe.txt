# Checklist for preparing a release exe for DSSAT-CSM:

- CMakeLists.txt - change the version number. This brands the output files.

- Manually add the resource file to the project after rebuilding the project with new CMakeLists.txt.

- Tag with a version number
- After testing, pull everything into the “release” branch in git
- Build the exe from the “release” branch with the release-mode compiler settings.
  - check that the exe has the correct version branding
  - check that output files have the correct version branding
- Pull everything into the DSSAT “release” branch on Github for archive.
