!Above 2 lines re-done by K. J. Boote, based on USDA-ARS SAP4.3, 2008, see Tables 2.6 and 2.7
!and cited references, summarizing a 4% grain yield/biomass increase for doubling of CO2.
!Maize model now gives 4.59 & 4.24% grain yield increase from 330-660 or 350-700, respectively, and
!1.17% from 380 to 440 (SAP4.3 cites 1%).  Biomass increase is 3.23 & 2.93%, respectively & 0.88%.
!Sensitivity for 5 irrigated/non-stressed maize experiments (UFGA, FLSC, IBWA, SIAZ, and IUAF).
!The ET is reduced 12.74 & 13.50% from 330 to 660, and T reduced 17.08 & 18.12% from 350 to 700ppm.
!Function based on stomatal resistance method of Allen et al.  CO2 effect on ET and T are good and
!did not need to be changed.

!At emergence and end of leaf growth: 
!Optimum shoot P concentration (%) = 0.684 - 0.108X (Jones, 1983) 
!At physiological maturity: 
!Optimum shoot P concentration (%) = 0.238 - 0.0056X (Jones, 1983)
!Where:
!X is the growth stage.
!Emergence was defined as growth stage 0 (X = 0), end of leaf growth as growth stage 4, and 
!physiological maturity as growth stage 10 (Jones, 1983). Minimum shoot P concentration was 
!taken as 60% of the estimated optimum (Daroub et al., 2003).
