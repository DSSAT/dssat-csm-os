*MAIZE ECOTYPE COEFFICIENTS: MZCER048 MODEL
!
! COEFF   DEFINITIONS
! =====   ===========
! ECO#    Code for the ecotype to which a cultivar belongs (see *.cul
!         file)
! ECONAME Name of the ecotype, which is referenced from *.CUL file
! TBASE   Base temperature below which no development occurs, C
! TOPT    Temperature at which maximum development rate occurs during vegetative stages, C
! ROPT    Temperature at which maximum development rate occurs for reproductive stages, C
! P2O     Day length below which day length does not affect development rate, hours
! DJTI    Minimum days from end of juvenile stage to tassel initiation if the cultivar
!	         is not photoperiod sensitive, days
! GDDE    Growing degree days per cm seed depth required for emergence, GDD/cm
! DSGFT   GDD from silking to effective grain filling period, C
! RUE     Radiation use efficiency, g plant dry matter/MJ PAR
! KCAN    Canopy light extinction coefficient for daily PAR.
! TSEN    Critical temperature below which leaf damage occurs (default 6Â°C)
! CDAY    Number of cold days parameter (default 15.0 )
! FOZ1    Ozone stress factor for photosynthesis (0.00-1.00), 0.00 = off, 0.15 = ozone tolerant, 0.30 = intermediate, 0.60 = sensitive
! SFOZ1   Ozone stress factor for leaf senescence (0.00-1.00), 0.00 = off, 0.10 = ozone tolerant, 0.20 = intermediate, 0.40 = sensitive
! OBASE   Base mean 7-hour (M7) ozone damage threshold, default = 25.0 ppb
