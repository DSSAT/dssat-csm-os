$ECOTYPES:CSCRP045

! LAST EDIT: 13/02/11

! Coefficients presented here have no direct equivalents in the
! previous Dssat cassava model, which did not have a set of
! ecotype coefficients. Some of those present have been generated
! from coefficients present in the cultivar file of the previous
! Dssat model. Others have been developed by taking into account
! the characteristics of a limited number of groups of cultivars.
! The groupings are likely to change as more experience is gained,
! and they should should not be taken as 'fixed'.

! Users should also be aware that some of the coefficients are likely
! to vary from region to region, reflecting either an incomplete
! understanding of the environmental physiology of cassava, or an
! inadequate incorporation of aspects of current understanding.
! For example,PARUE may vary from region to region,possibly
! because of variation in the proportion of diffuse radiation
! in the incoming solar and sky components.
