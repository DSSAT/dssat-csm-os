! Coefficients used in the Cropsim model differ from those used in
! earlier DSSAT wheat/barley models. They can be calculated
! (approximately) from V3.5 coefficients as follows:
! VREQ  = P1V(v3.5)*10
! VBASE = 0.0          
! VEFF  = MAX(0.0,1.0-P1V(V3.5)*10/50)
! PPS1  = P1D(V3.5)*20
! PPS2  = 0.0
! P1    = PHINT(V3.5)*4.2
! P2    = PHINT(V3.5)*3*0.3   (V3.5P2*0.3)
! P3    = PHINT(V3.5)*3*0.7   (V3.5P2*0.7)
! P4    = PHINT(V3.5)*2       (V3.5P3)
! P5    = 80
! P6    = 0
! P7    = 120
! P8    = P5(V3.5)*20 + 430
! G#WTS  = G1(V3.5)*5 + 5
! GWTS  = (G2(V3.5)*0.35+0.65) * P5/20
! SHWTS = G3(V3.5)*0.7
! PHINT = PHINT(V3.5)

! Converted coefficients,and those listed below,should always be
! tested by using them with real experiments and comparing model
! outputs with measured values. Users should also be aware that
! some of the coefficients (eg.PHINT) may vary from region to
! region,and perhaps even from sowing date to sowing date,reflecting
! the current incomplete understanding of the environmental physiology
! of barley and other cereals.

! Pn          Duration of phase n where n is phase number (PVoC.D) BUT P3 and

!             internally depending on the leaf number at the end of phase 1.

! PHINT       Interval between successive leaf appearances. (oC.d)

! VBASE       Vernalization requirement before any effect (VDays)
! VEFF        Vernalization effect (Rate reduction when unvernalized (fr)

! *  The programme has been written to read sensitivity for all phases so that
