*MAIZE ECOTYPE COEFFICIENTS: MZIXM047 MODEL
!
! COEFF   DEFINITIONS
! =====   ===========
! ECO#    Code for the ecotype to which a cultivar belongs (see *.cul
!         file)
! ECONAME Name of the ecotype, which is referenced from *.CUL file
! TBASE   Base temperature below which no development occurs, C
! TOPT    Temperature at which maximum development rate occurs during vegetative stages, C
! ROPT    Temperature at which maximum development rate occurs for reproductive stages, C
! P2O     Daylength below which daylength does not affect development rate, hours
! DJTI    Minimum days from end of juvenile stage to tassel initiation if the cultivar
! 	       is not photoperiod sensitive, days
! GDDE    Growing degree days per cm seed depth required for emergence, GDD/cm
! DSGFT   GDD from silking to effective grain filling period, C
! RUE     Radiation use efficiency, g plant dry matter/MJ PAR
! KCAN    Canopy light extinction coefficient for daily PAR.
! PSTM    Parameter controlling stem C partitioning during ISTAGES 3, 4 (0-1) 
!          Higher PSTM, more DM into stem, less into leaves
! PEAR    Parameter controlling ear C partitioning during ear growth 
!         (250 GDD before flowering-end ISTAGE 4)
! TSEN    Critical temperature below which leaf damage occurs (default 6°C)
! CDAY    Number of cold days parameter (default 15.0 )
