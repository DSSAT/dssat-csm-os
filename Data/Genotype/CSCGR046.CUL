! Coefficients used in the Cropsim cassava module differ from those used
! in the earlier DSSAT cassava model. It is best,therefore,not to attempt
! to convert 'old' coefficients, but to calibrate anew using the available
! experiments. And even with a fresh calibration,it is good practice to 
! test any set of coefficients by using them with real experiments that
! were not used for calibration,and then comparing model outputs to 
! measured values. 

! Users should also be aware that some of the coefficients (eg.PHINT) may 
! vary from region to region,and perhaps even from sowing date to sowing 
! date,reflecting not only the current incomplete understanding of the 
! environmental physiology of the crop, but also deficiencies in defining 
! the initial conditions and computing the microbial release of nitrogen 
! and other nutrients.

! present merely to allow the experiments to be run. A user should spend time calibrating for
