*PEPPER GENOTYPE COEFFICIENTS: CRGRO047 MODEL
!
! PARAM   DEFINITIONS
! =====   ===========
! EXPNO   Number of experiments used to estimate cultivar parameters
! ECO#    Code for the ecotype to which this cultivar belongs (see *.eco file)
! CSDL    Critical Short Day Length below which reproductive development
!         progresses WITH daylength effect (for longday plants) (hour)
! PPSEN   Slope of the relative response of development to photoperiod with time
!         (negative for longday plants) (1/hour)
! EM-FL   Time between plant emergence and flower appearance (R1)
!         (photothermal days)
! FL-SH   Time between first flower and first pod (R3) (photothermal days)
! FL-SD   Time between first flower and first seed (R5) (photothermal days)
! SD-PM   Time between first seed (R5) and physiological maturity (R7)
!         (photothermal days)
! FL-LF   Time between first flower (R1) and end of leaf expansion
!         (photothermal days)
! LFMAX   Maximum leaf photosynthesis rate at 30 C, 350 vpm CO2, and high light
!         (mg CO2/m2-s)
! SLAVR   Specific leaf area of cultivar under standard growth conditions
!         (cm2/g)
! SIZLF   Maximum size of full leaf (three leaflets) (cm2)
! XFRT    Maximum fraction of daily growth that is partitioned to seed + shell
! WTPSD   Maximum weight per seed (g)
! SFDUR   Seed filling duration for pod cohort at standard growth conditions
!         (photothermal days)
! SDPDV   Average seed per pod under standard growing conditions (#/pod)
! PODUR   Time required for cultivar to reach final pod load under optimal
!         conditions (photothermal days)
! TRESH   Threshing percentage. The maximum ratio of (seed/(seed+shell))
!         at maturity. Causes seeds to stop growing as their dry weight
!         increases until shells are filled in a cohort.
! SDPRO   Fraction protein in seeds (g(protein)/g(seed))
! SDLIP   Fraction oil in seeds (g(oil)/g(seed))
