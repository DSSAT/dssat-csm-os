$ECOTYPES:BACRP045

! LAST EDIT: 13/02/11

! Coefficients presented here differ from those used in previous
! model versions. They have been developed by taking into account
! the characteristics of a limited number of groups of cultivars.
! The groupings are likely to change as more experience is gained,
! and they should should not be taken as 'fixed'.

! Users should be aware that some of the coefficients are likely
! to vary from region to region,reflecting either an incomplete
! understanding of the environmental physiology of wheat,or an
! inadequate incorporation of aspects of current understanding.
! For example,PARUE may vary from region to region,possibly
! because of variation in the proportion of diffuse radiation
! in the incoming solar and sky components,or because of 
! differences in the contribution of photosynthetic surfaces 
! not accounted for in the model (eg.awns,peduncles),or even
! because of differences in disease intensities.
