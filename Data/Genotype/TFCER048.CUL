*TEFF GENOTYPE COEFFICIENTS: TFCER048 MODEL
!
! COEFF    DEFINITIONS
! ======== ===========
! VAR#     Identification code or number for a specific cultivar.
! VAR-NAME Name of cultivar.
! EXPNO    Number of experiments used to estimate cultivar parameters
! ECO#     Ecotype code for this cultivar points to the Ecotype in the ECO
!          file (currently not used).

! P1       Time period (expressed as growing degree days [GDD] in oC-d above a
!          base temperature of 9oC) from seedling emergence during which the
!          teff plant is not responsive to changes in photoperiod. This period
!          is also referred to as the basic vegetative phase of the plant.
!          Range: 150-800 oC-d. 
!          Calibration: flexible, compare with observed panicle initiation 
!          and flowering dates.

! P2O      Critical photoperiod or the longest day length (in hours) at
!          which the development occurs at a maximum rate. At values higher
!          than P2O developmental rate is slowed, hence there is delay due
!          to longer day lengths. 
!          Range 11-13 h. Default 12 h. 
!          Calibration: Do not go below 11 unless data are available. 

! P2R      Extent to which phasic development leading to panicle initiation
!          is delayed (expressed as GDD in oC-d) for each hour increase in
!          photoperiod above P2O. 
!          Range 5-300 oC-d. 
!          Calibration: Modern teff varieties will have values in 
!          the lower range.

! P5       Time period in GDD oC-d) from beginning of grain filling (3 to
!          4 days after flowering) to physiological maturity with a base
!          temperature of 9oC. 
!          Range 150-850 oC-d. 
!          Calibration: Ensure P1, P2O and P2R are correctly calibrated for 
!          anthesis data. Then calibrate P5 for observed maturity date.

! G1       Potential spikelet number coefficient as estimated from the
!          number of spikelets per g of main culm dry weight (less leaf
!          blades and sheaths plus spikes) at anthesis. 
!          Range 50-75 #/g. A typical value is 55 #/g.

! G2       Single grain weight (g) under ideal growing conditions, i.e.
!          nonlimiting light, water, nutrients, and absence of pests
!          and diseases.
!          Range 0.015-0.030 g. Default 0.025 g.
!          Calibration: Very low flexibility. 

! G3       Tillering coefficient (scalar value) relative to IR64 cultivar
!          under ideal conditions. 
!          Range 0.7-1.3.
!          Calibration: A higher tillering cultivar would have a coefficient 
!          greater than 1.0.

! PHINT    Phyllochron Interval (oC-d). Time interval in degree-days for each 
!          leaf-tip to appear under non-stressed conditions.  
!          Range 55-90 oC-d. Default 83 oC-d.
!          Calibration: Recommend to not change unless field data on leaf 
!          numbers are available.

! THOT     Temperature (oC) above which spikelet sterility is affected by 
!          high temperature.  
!          Range 25-34 oC. Default 28oC. 
!          Calibration: recommended to not change unless hot environment
!          data are available. Convert old cultivars THOT = 28./G4.

! TCLDP    Temperature (oC) below which panicle initiation is further delayed 
!          (other than P1, P2O and P2R) by low temperature.
!          Range 12-18 oC. Default 15oC. 
!          Calibration: recommended to not change unless cold environment
!          data are available. Convert old cultivars TCLDP = 15.*G5.

! TCLDF    Temperature (oC) below which spikelet sterility is affected by 
!          low temperature.
!          Range 10-20 oC. Default 15oC. 
!          Calibration: recommended to not change unless cold environment
!          data are available. Convert old cultivars TCLDF = 15.*G5.
