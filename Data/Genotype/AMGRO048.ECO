*AMARANTH ECOTYPE COEFFICIENTS: CRGRO048 MODEL
!
! COEFF   DEFINITIONS
! =====   ===========
! ECO#    Code for the ecotype to which a cultivar belongs (see *.cul
!         file)
! ECONAME Name of the ecotype, which is referenced from *.CUL file
! MG      Maturity group number for this ecotype, such as maturity
!         group in soybean
! TM      Indicator of temperature adaptation
! THVAR   Minimum rate of reproductive development under long days
!         and optimal temperature
! PL-EM   Time between planting and emergence (V0) (thermal days)
! EM-V1   Time required from emergence to first true leaf (V1), thermal
!         days
! V1-JU   Time required from first true leaf to end of juvenile phase,
!         thermal days
! JU-R0   Time required for floral induction, equal to the minimum
!         number of days for floral induction under optimal temperature and
!         daylengths, photothermal days
! PM06    Proportion of time between first flower and first pod for
!         first peg (peanut only)
! PM09    Proportion of time between first seed and physiological
!         maturity that the last seed can be formed
! LNGSH   Time required for growth of individual shells (photothermal
!         days)
! R7-R8   Time between physiological (R7) and harvest maturity (R8) (days)
! FL-VS   Time from first flower to last leaf on main stem (photothermal
!         days)
! TRIFOL  Rate of appearance of leaves on the mainstem (leaves per
!         thermal day)
! RWIDTH  Relative width of this ecotype in comparison to the standard
!         width per node (YVSWH) defined in the species file (*.SPE)
! RHGHT   Relative height of this ecotype in comparison to the
!         standard height per node (YVSHT) defined in the species file
!         (*.SPE)
! SIZELF  The size of a normal upper node leaf (nodes 8 - 10) of
!         variety I, used to adjust leaf area expansion during
!         sink-limited phase of vegetative growth, i.e., prior to
!         VSSINK nodes on the main stem (cm2/leaf)
! R1PPO   Increase in daylength sensitivity after R1 (CSDVAR and CLDVAR
!         both decrease with the same amount) (h)
! OPTBI   Minimum daily temperature above which there is no effect on
!         slowing normal development toward flowering (oC)
! SLOBI   Slope of relationship reducing progress toward flowering if
!         TMIN for the day is less than OPTBI
