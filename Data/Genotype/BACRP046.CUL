! Coefficients used in the Cropsim model differ from those used in
! earlier DSSAT wheat/barley models. They can be calculated
! (approximately) from V3.5 coefficients as follows:
! VREQ  = P1V(v3.5)*10
! VBASE = 0.0          
! VEFF  = MAX(0.0,1.0-P1V(V3.5)*10/50)
! PPS1  = P1D(V3.5)*20
! PPS2  = 0.0
! P1 = 300*PHINT/70)     
! P2 = 0.25*(3.2*PHINT)) 
! P3 = 0.75*(3.2*PHINT)) 
! P4 = 2.4*(PHINT)       
! P5 = 0.25*(2.9*PHINT)) 
! P6 = 0.10*(2.9*PHINT)) 
! P7 = 0.65*(2.9*PHINT)) 
! P8    = P5(V3.5)*40 + 300
! G#WTS  = G1(V3.5)*5 + 5
! GWTS  = (G2(V3.5)*0.35+0.65) * P5/20
! SHWTS = G3(V3.5)*0.7
! PHINT = PHINT(V3.5)

! Converted coefficients,and those listed below,should always be
! tested by using them with real experiments and comparing model
! outputs with measured values. Users should also be aware that
! some of the coefficients (eg.PHINT) may vary from region to
! region,and perhaps even from sowing date to sowing date,reflecting
! the current incomplete understanding of the environmental physiology
! of wheat and other cereals.

! In Ceres3.5, P1=300 for PHINT=75; P2+P3=225; P4=150; P5+6+7=200,
! with anthesis occurring in P4 after 60 units.
