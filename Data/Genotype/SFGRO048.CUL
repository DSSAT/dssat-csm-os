*SAFFLOWER CULTIVAR COEFFICIENTS: CRGRO048 MODEL
!
! COEFF       DEFINITIONS
! =====       ===========
! VAR#        Identification code or number for a specific cultivar.
! VAR-NAME    Name of cultivar
! EXPNO       Number of experiments used to estimate cultivar parameters
! ECO#        Code for the ecotype to which this cultivar belongs (see *.eco file)
! CSDL        Critical Short Day Length below which reproductive development
!             progresses with no daylength effect (for shortday plants) (hour)
! PPSEN       Slope of the relative response of development to photoperiod with time
!             (positive for shortday plants) (1/hour)
! EM-FL       Time between plant emergence and flower appearance (R1)
!             (photothermal days)
! FL-SH       Time between first flower and first pod (R3) (photothermal days)
! FL-SD       Time between first flower and first seed (R5) (photothermal days)
! SD-PM       Time between first seed (R5) and physiological maturity (R7)
!             (photothermal days)
! FL-LF       Time between first flower (R1) and end of leaf expansion
!             (photothermal days)
! LFMAX       Maximum leaf photosynthesis rate at 30 C, 350 vpm CO2, and high light
!             (mg CO2/m2-s)
! SLAVR       Specific leaf area of cultivar under standard growth conditions
!             (cm2/g)
! SIZLF       Maximum size of full leaf (three leaflets) (cm2)
! XFRT        Maximum fraction of daily growth that is partitioned to seed + shell
! WTPSD       Maximum weight per seed (g)
! SFDUR       Seed filling duration for pod cohort at standard growth conditions
!             (photothermal days)
! SDPDV       Average seed per pod under standard growing conditions (#/pod)
! PODUR       Time required for cultivar to reach final pod load under optimal
!             conditions (photothermal days)
! THRSH       Threshing percentage. The maximum ratio of (seed/(seed+shell))
!             at maturity. Causes seeds to stop growing as their dry weight
!             increases until shells are filled in a cohort.
! SDPRO       Fraction protein in seeds (g(protein)/g(seed))
! SDLIP       Fraction oil in seeds (g(oil)/g(seed))
!
!             P/G/N:Phenology/Growth/Not used for calbration
!
! SSingh CREATED A LONG DAY TYPE, BUT PPSEN should be NEGATIVE, SO MAY NOT WORK. 
! 2nd and 3rd cultivars in New Mexico were evaluated, but were not calibrated to be different, and data are not shown.
!
!9/1/2021 kjb, increased SLAMAX from 650 to 750 in spe for German cultivars.  Needed because removing LAI protection reduced SLA and LAI slightly.
! Initially calibrated with actual simulated wtpsd in cultivar file.  See modified *.cul GC for P18311
!
!KJB - edited NM cultivars 9/1/21, 9/14, 9/15.  Switch to Ritchie Stage 1 soil evap helped.  Strange,  2014 season had very slow start (TURFAC with R-S) 
!Personally, I think the soil file is not very good.  But everything improved (RMSE & D) when switched from S-R to Ritchie Stage 1 soil evap.
!The shorter FL-SD (with longer FL-SH) with longer PODUR is totally needed, as model was late to pod and PHI, but PHI increased too fast. 
! increase in lfmax and decreased SLAVR had minor effects.  Species modified CARSD from .420 to .470, because seed did not sum to 1.00.  Actually helped.
