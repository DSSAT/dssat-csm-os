!The field measurements at Rothamsted were done with one soil layer of 0-23 cm, but the soil
!profile is much deeper. There were, however, no data on texture, soil-N, pH etc. for these
!deeper layers; these were filled in with artificial data, just to get the model running
!with a suffiently deep profile to get the water balance realistic. Don't pay any attention 
!though to the results of these deeper layers.
!
!DSSAT uses a default soil-layer distribution of 5-15-30-45-etc. This makes the third layer
!15 cm thick with lower boundary at 30 cm depth, which is thus far too much. Since in the
!Rothamsted soil profile (ROTH5901) the SOM carbon declines quite strongly after 23 cm depth
!(from 2.45 to 1.50%), this automatic redistribution of soil layers would mean that the
!15-30-cm layer gets a C concentration of somewhere in-between 2.45% and 1.50% instead of
!there being a 0-23-cm layer with 2.45% SOM and a 23-30-cm layer with 1.50% C. To get good
!results, this fileX has to be run without redistribution of the soil profile or the results
!have to be recalculated manually.

!The soil texture data were expressed in European (or ISSS) textural units, in which silt is
!the 2-20-µm class, while DSSAT and CENTURY use the American unit system with silt equal to
!2-50 µm. This not only affects the SOM decomposition process directly, as the fractions of
!sand and clay influence the SOM decomposition rate and the flows between pools in the
!CENTURY-based SOM/residue module, but also indirectly, as texture was used for estimating
!the soil-water retention characteristics. A sensitivity analysis in which the model was run
!for both the measured silt (2-20 µm) fraction of 23% and for an estimated silt (2-50 µm)
!fraction of 30% (and thus a reduced sand fraction) showed that the percentage of silt hardly 
!affected the results. The LL, DUL, SAT for this were estimated using Rawls et al. (1982;
!Transactions ASAE 25: 1316-1328).
