*TILLAGE
! DSSAT v4.5; 09/30/2010
!  Tilllage Input File
!  
!  JWW/CP/BB ...
!  13/ 5/2003
!  21/ 8/2008 - JWW minor edits, added roller harrow
!   7/11/2008 - JWW changed CN effect to reduce values for most tillage
!  Implement names are changed substantially from Details.Cde
!  
!  Initial values are from Table 5-5 of RUSLE manual (which in turn relates to ASAE nomenclature) 
!  and the SWAT manual (www.brc.tamus.edu/swat/manual2000/tilldb/dflt_tableA9.html)
!  RUSLE was used for Residue incorporated (presented in Table 5-5 as the inverse -- residue
!    left on the surface) and percent soil surface disturbed.
!  SWAT was the source of mixing efficiency and depth.
!  
!  A useful reference for basic farm machinery concepts is:
!  Hunt, D.  Farm Power and Machinery Management 10th Ed.
!  It does not deal with effectiveness of tillage or incorporation of mulch.
!  
!  Discussion notes:
!  1.  Use of percentages vs fractions:
!         Although it makes more sense from a modeling perspective to use fractional changes 
!         (e.g., 0.15) than percent changes, we expect most users to prefer percentages.
!  
!  2.  "Field operation" vs. "tillage operation":
!         We tend to discuss "tillage effects" but for completeness, the overall approach really 
!         is for "field operations."
!  
!  3.  Handling of depth here vs in file X (proportional adjustment)
!         In TILLAGE.INP, the maximum depth of incorporation and mixing are assumed to be the
!         same.  Thus, both are set by the maximum value of SLB.  This maximum should be greater
!         than or equal to TDEP as reported in FILEX.
!  
!  4.  Depths reported for RUSLE and SWAT are quite different, especially given
!      that RUSLE is defined as "depth in which 75% of residue is buried":
!                          __Depth_(cm)____

!          Moldboard            20      15     
!          Spiketooth harrow     5       3
!      Is there a difference between mixing and incorporation?
!      Is the depth pre- or post-tillage operation
!      We need to chase original sources for such data.
!  
!  5.  CN2T  HPAN  SBDT  SKST all need more research.  
!      There were no initial estimates available.  Default values used:
!        CN2T - +/- 5 or 10 based on expected effect
!        HPAN - 0
!        SBDT - +/- 5 or 10 based on expected effect
!        SKST - +/- 5 or 10 based on expected effect
!      
!  7.  SSDT (% soil surface disturbed) and CN2T (% change in curve number) should interact.
!      For the moment, we assume that CN2T is average effect over entire soil surface.
!
!  8.  What outputs would people expect to see for tillage?
!

!  
!  Definitions of parameters given in this file:
!  TIMPL - implement/operation code from DSSAT standard in FILEX
!  DESCRIPTION - Brief name of the implement (e.g., "moldboard plow")
!  COMMENT - Further information that would clarify the conditions for which the parameters
!      are considered valid (e.g., "into sod," ...)
!  
!  CN2T - Percent change in SCS curve number immediately after ith field operation.
!  RINP - Percent of residue incorporated
!  SSDT - Percent soil surface that is disturbed by the field operation.
!  MIXT - Mixing efficiency of tillage event
!  HPAN - Percent reduction in hard pan (if depth is sufficient to reach pan)
!  
!  SLB  - Soil layer depth, cm -- maximum potential of operation.   
!  SBDT - Percent change in bulk density just after field operation
!  SKST - Percent change in saturated hydraulic conductivity just after field operation (cm/day)
!  
!  Definitions of parameters also worth keeping in mind:
!  TDEP  - depth of residue incorporation (here defined as 100% vs 75% in RUSLE
!  NTILL - number of tillage operations entered 
!
