! DSSAT v4.8; 07/27/2021

! Headers used in the @ line to identify variables are listed first, codes to
! identify methods, chemicals, etc. are listed next in sections that relate to
! specific aspects (Chemicals;Crop and weed species;Diseases and pests;Drainage;
! Environment modification factors;Fertilizers,inoculants and amendments;
! Harvest components;Harvest size categories;Methods-fertilizer and chemical
! applications;Methods-irrigation and water management;Methods-soil analysis;
! Planting materials;Plant distribution;Residues and organic fertilizers;
! Rotations;Soil texture;and Tillage implements).
!
! The fields in the file are as follows:
!  CDE   The 'universal' code used to facilitate data interchange.
!  DESCRIPTION  A description of the code, with units.
!  SO    The source of the codes (IB=IBSNAT). Codes added by a user should be
!        referenced in this field and the name and address of the person adding
!        the code should be entered as a comment (ie.with a '!' in column 1)
!        below this note. This is important to ensure that information from
!        different workers can be easily integrated. Users adding codes should
!        also ensure that those constructed by adding a number to a section
!        code (eg.FE001,CH001) are clearly identified with a letter in the third
!        position (eg.FEK01 for a fertilizer code added by someone with a family
!        name beginning with K).
