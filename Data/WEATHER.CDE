! Headers used in the @ line to identify variables are listed first; codes
! ('flags') used to designate data types are listed next.
!
! The fields in the file are as follows:
!  CDE   The 'universal' code used to facilitate data interchange.
!  DESCRIPTION  A description of the code, with units.
!  SO    The source of the codes (IB=IBSNAT). Codes added by a user should be
!        referenced in this field and the name and address of the person adding
!        the code should be entered as a comment (ie.with a '!' in column 1)
!        below this note. This is important to ensure that information from
!        different workers can be easily integrated.
