c     Better shoot popn model from GTP Canegro
c     ----------------------------------------
c     MJ, Jun 2015.  Work done for SASRI project 08RE14.
c     The code here is reduced to the absolute minimum
c     required to calculate a total shoot population.
c     This is then handed to the POPLT3 function to assign
c     to cohort groups etc.
c     ---------------------------------------
c     Note: only the tiller population INCREASE is sim-
c     ulated here.  The senescence is handled in POPLI3.
c     This is to be called AFTER emergence.  This assumes
c     that the first plant is about to emerge.
c     ALso note, however, that the population of primary 
c     shoots is determined by thermal time to emergence
c     (base 16 deg C) while secondary shoots might have a
c     different base temperature.  Hence, DTT_EM and DTT_POP
c     are both input parameters
