*CODES FOR SOIL DATA
! DSSAT v4.7; 04/11/2021
!
! Codes currently used for both detailed profile analysis and occasional
! analysis of the surface layers are listed. The soil analysis codes are
! also listed in the DATA.CDE file.
!
! The fields in the file are as follows:
!  CDE   The 'universal' code used to facilitate data interchange.
!  DESCRIPTION  A description of the code, with units.
!  SO    The source of the codes (IB=IBSNAT). Codes added by a user should be
!        referenced in this field and the name and address of the person adding
!        the code should be entered as a comment (ie.with a '!' in column 1)
!        below this note. This is important to ensure that information from
!        different workers can be easily integrated.
