!         T1    T2    T3    T4 
!Factors of leaf scenecence were 1.,1.,3.1,11.1, but reduced by half on 10 Dec. 2014 as Senthold suggested that these values are too much.
  GTMAX -50.   30.   40.   60.     !Tmax thersholds used for effect of grain number; maximum temeprature values used for interpolation of effects
  GRDUH   0.    0.    0.    0.     !Tmax effect on grain number; to TURN-ON set values to 0. 0. -50. -50. and to TURN-OFF set all values to zero
  GTMIN -50.   -1.    2.   50.     !Tmin thresholds used for effect of grain number
  GRDUL   0.    0.    0.    0.     !Tmin effect for grain number; to TURN-ON set values to -50. -50. 0. 0. and to TURN-OFF set all values to zero
  DTTPT  20.   80.  120.           !Sum of thermal temepratures (DTT) point to set up DTT factor of Temperature effect of the Grain #; DTT are from end of ear development.
  DTTF    0.    0.    0.           !DTT factor as function of DTT points; to turn-on set values to 0. 1. 0. and to turn-off set all values to zero
!Note GRDUH,GRDUL and DTTF should be turned-on and turned-off together to get the effect of temperature on grain number 
  VPD     0.    1.    7.    8.     !vapor pressure deficit used in canopy temperature effect, VPD values of refernce for interpolation
  VPDF    0.    0.3   1.    1.     !vapor pressure deficit effect used in canopy temperature effect;these are values used to modify the effect of VPD on canop temeprature effect
! To turn-on VPDF, set values to 0., .3, 1., 1.,and to turn-off, set all values to 0.
! when we set values of vpdf to 0, then canopy temperature is equal to the maximum air temperature and hence there will be no cooling effect
! To see the effect of canopy temeprature with out vpdf effect, set the values of vpdf all to 1.
  TCSLP -12.0                      !Canopy temperature modification slope; to turn-off just comment on this line and to turn-on remove the comment
! TCSLP  0.0                       !Turn off Canopy temperature modification slope; when TCSLP is turn-on comment this line and when TCSLP is turn-off, remove the comment from this line
  TCINT  6.0                       !Canopy temperature modification intercept; To turn-off, comment this line and to turn-on remove comment from this line
! TCINT  0.0                       !Turn off Canopy temperature modification intercept; no comment on this line means the TCINT is turn-on and visa-vis
  TTHLD -50.0                      ! Minimum temperature (Tmin) threshold for frost effect (frost effect starts when Tmin<-5)
! To turn-on frost effect set the TTHLD to -5 or below -5 depending on your Tmin threshold you are interested in to see the effect
! To tun-off frost effect, set the TTHLD to a value beyond the range of minimum Tmin (e.g.-30 oC)
  FRSTF  0.1                       ! Frost Factor's factor- a factor for 10% leaf frosted for each OC dcrease in minimum temeperture
! TBASE   0.                       ! Base temperature below which no development occurs, C
  CRWNT  .02                       ! crown temperature
  SNOW   0                         ! Switch for snow effect of frost (0=switch off; 1=switch-on)
! Canopy temeprature effect and vpdf effect need to be turned on and off together because the purpse of vpdf is to moderate the canopy temeprature effect
!!Note: for temeprature effect on leaf senescence; the orginal option is with (T, F) combinations of ((-10, 1) ; (34 , 1); (34.1, 3) and (50, 11)). 
! For no heat stress on leaf scenescence, set the values of F1..F4 to 1 and to use different threshold, change T2; e.g. if we use 32 for T2 which means we set the heat stress threshold at 32 0C

*PHOTOSYNTHESIS PARAMETERS 
  PARSR   0.50      !Conversion of solar radiation to PAR 
  CO2X     0   220   280   330   400   490   570   750   990  9999

!Note:  Photosynthesis response to CO2 for C-4 maize, sorghum, millet is reduced from prior.
!Above 2 lines re-done by K. J. Boote, based on USDA-ARS SAP4.3, 2008, see Tables 2.6 and 2.7
!and cited references, summarizing a 4% grain yield/biomass increase for doubling of CO2.
!Maize model now gives 4.59 & 4.24% grain yield increase from 330-660 or 350-700, respectively, and
!1.17% from 380 to 440 (SAP4.3 cites 1%).  Biomass increase is 3.23 & 2.93%, respectively & 0.88%.
!Sensitivity for 5 irrigated/non-stressed maize experiments (UFGA, FLSC, IBWA, SIAZ, and IUAF).
!The ET is reduced 12.74 & 13.50% from 330 to 660, and T reduced 17.08 & 18.12% from 350 to 700ppm.
!Function based on stomatal resistance method of Allen et al.  CO2 effect on ET and T are good and
!did not need to be changed.

*APCO2 APSIM CO2 PARAMETERS 
  TEFAC    1        ! Switch for transpiration effect coeff; turn-on = 1 and turn-off = 0 ! Use  turn-on for all simulations
  RUEFAC   0        ! switch for RUE Factor; turn-on = 1 and turn off = 0 !Use turn-on for all simulations

!Note: the above switch for TEFAC and RUEFAC mean that 1 is switch on and 0 is swich off. 
!When we switch-off the effect of CO2 it means that the TEFAC (transp_eff_coeff) will set to a value of 0.006 and RUE (rue_factor) to 1

!At emergence and end of leaf growth: 
!Optimum shoot P concentration (%) = 0.684 - 0.108X (Jones, 1983) 
!At physiological maturity: 
!Optimum shoot P concentration (%) = 0.238 - 0.0056X (Jones, 1983)
!Where:
!X is the growth stage.
!Emergence was defined as growth stage 0 (X = 0), end of leaf growth as growth stage 4, and 
!physiological maturity as growth stage 10 (Jones, 1983). Minimum shoot P concentration was 
!taken as 60% of the estimated optimum (Daroub et al., 2003).
