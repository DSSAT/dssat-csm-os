! Canegro Sugarcane Plant Module SPECIES file
! This file contains coefficients that are used for ALL cultivars of sugarcane.
! DO NOT change these values, unless you are REALLY sure you are right!
! Lines starting with an exclamation mark or a '*' are effectively ignored.
! Blank lines are ignored

! All values consist of a text variable name, followed by an equals sign ('=').
! All text before the equals sign (on one line), with leading and trailing spaces 
! removed, will be considered the variable name.  All text, minus the spaces, 
! following the equals sign will be considered the variable's values.  Variables
! are not ordered, and need not be arranged according to the headings.

! ** ALWAYS enter REAL values e.g. 0., 1.2, 67., NOT integers **

! The headings give an indication of where parameters are used in the code.
